It is a serious condition. If you have it, the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your lungs become hard and narrow. Your heart has to work harder to pump the blood through. Over time, your heart weakens and cannot do its job and you can develop heart failure. Symptoms of PH include - Shortness of breath during routine activity, such as climbing two flights of stairs - Tiredness - Chest pain - A racing heartbeat - Pain on the upper right side of the abdomen - Decreased appetite As PH worsens, you may find it hard to do any physical activities. There are two main kinds of PH. One runs in families or appears for no known reason. The other kind is related to another condition, usually heart or lung disease. There is no cure for PH.

Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. A reading of - 119/79 or lower is normal blood pressure - 140/90 or higher is high blood pressure - Between 120 and 139 for the top number, or between 80 and 89 for the bottom number is called prehypertension. Prehypertension means you may end up with high blood pressure, unless you take steps to prevent it. High blood pressure usually has no symptoms, but it \n\n[MedQuAD 3] Topic: 4_MPlus_Health_Topics_QA\nSourceFile: /content/drive/MyDrive/FIAP_PosTech/Tech_Challenge_3/data/raw/medquad/4_MPlus_Health_Topics_QA/0000470.xml\nQUESTION: What is (are) Kidney Disease ?\nANSWER: Kidney disease is a problem with your kidneys.

Answer : High blood pressure, also called hypertension, usually has no symptoms. But it can cause serious problems such as stroke, heart failure, heart attack and kidney failure. If you cannot control your high blood pressure through lifestyle changes such as losing weight and reducing sodium in your diet, you may need medicines. Blood pressure medicines work in different ways to lower blood pressure. Some remove extra fluid and salt from the body. Others slow down the heartbeat or relax and widen blood vessels.

As a result, your body does not get the oxygen it needs. Emphysema makes it hard to catch your breath. You may also have a chronic cough and have trouble breathing during exercise. The most common cause is cigarette smoking. If you smoke, quitting can help prevent you from getting the disease. If you already have emphysema, not smoking might keep it from getting worse. Treatment is based on whether your symptoms are mild, moderate or severe. Treatments include inhalers, oxygen, medications and sometimes surgery to relieve symptoms and prevent complications.", "sources": "Sources:\n- EHR fields: None\n- MedQuAD snippets: [MedQuAD 1] 4_MPlus_Health_Topics_QA | /content/drive/MyDrive/FIAP_PosTech/Tech_Challenge_3/data/raw/medquad/4_MPlus_Health_Topics_QA/0000066.xml; [MedQuAD 2] 4_MPlus_Health_Topics_QA | /content/drive/MyDrive/FIAP_PosTech/Tech_Challenge_3/data/raw/medquad/4_MPlus_Health_Topics_QA/0000065.xml; [MedQuAD 3] 4_MPlus_Health_Topics_QA | /content/drive/MyDrive/FIAP_PosTech/Tech_Challenge_3/data/raw/medquad/4_MPlus_Health_Topics_QA/0000323.xml"}
